SaaS Customer Churn & Retention Analysis


Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn behavior for Ravenstack, a SaaS
(subscription-based) platform.  
The objective is to understand why customers leave, identify
high-risk customer segments, analyze customer lifetime patterns, and
recommend data-driven strategies to improve retention.

The analysis combines multiple real-world SaaS datasets including account
details, subscription information, churn events, and customer support data.

Business Questions Answered

- Why are customers leaving the platform?
- Which customer segments are most likely to churn?
- How long do customers typically remain active?
- What actions can improve customer retention?


  Dataset Description

The project uses multiple structured datasets:

- Accounts – customer profile and signup information  
- Subscriptions – plan tier, billing, and revenue details  
- Churn Events – churn dates and reasons  
- Support Tickets – customer support interactions and satisfaction  

These datasets were merged into a single analytics-ready table for churn
analysis.

 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub (project hosting)


  Key Analysis & Visualizations

The project includes visual analysis to quickly identify insights:

- Churn Rate by Plan Tier
- Average Customer Lifetime by Plan Tier
- Support Tickets vs Churn
- Customer Satisfaction vs Churn

These visualizations help highlight behavioral and experience-driven churn
patterns.

 Key Insights

- Lower-tier subscription plans exhibit higher churn rates
- Customers with a higher number of support tickets are more likely to churn
- Higher-tier plans retain customers for longer durations
- Lower satisfaction scores strongly correlate with churn

Overall, churn appears to be driven more by customer experience and engagement
than pricing alone.

 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions can improve retention:

1. Improve onboarding experience in the first 30 days
2. Proactively engage customers with high support ticket volume
3. Encourage early feature adoption
4. Guide customers toward higher-value plans where appropriate
5. Monitor customer satisfaction as an early churn indicator
